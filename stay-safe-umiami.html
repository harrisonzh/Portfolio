    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Duration</h2>

    <h2>Project description</h2>
    <p>Since the start of school on August 17, more than 200 students and faculty members at the University of Miami have contracted the Coronavirus. It is very important to control the spread of the Coronavirus on campus. This project is the design of a <strong>location-based app focused on solving the problem of the spread of the Coronavirus</strong>, designed for a Human-Centered Design (HCD) class, Fall 2020.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Help students find protection resources on campus.</li>
      <li>Help students avoid contact with too many people.</li>
      <li>Help students to wash their hands regularly.</li>
      <li>Let students know when there are fewer people in a specific area.</li>
      <li>Tracking of UM confirmed COVID-19 cases in high-risk areas on campus.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>User research and interviews</li>
      <li>Competitive analysis</li>
      <li>Concept map</li>
      <li>User flow</li>
      <li>Site map</li>
      <li>Wireframes</li>
      <li>Prototype</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Target User</h2>
      <h3>UM students</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users care about their privacy.</li>
      <li>Users want to know when there are fewer people in a specific area.</li>
      <li>Don’t trust other people on campus.</li>
      <li>People want to determine the safety of a place before going there.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>Sample size: 18 participants in total</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>44% female 56% male</li>
      <li>9 participants for user segment A (students taking in-person or hybrid classes)</li>
      <li>5 participants for user segment B (students taking only online classes)</li>
      <li>4 participants for user segment C (faculty)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Affinity Diagrams</h3>
    <p>We grouped our research findings using Affinity Diagrams</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/StaySafeUMiami/Affinity_Diagrams.png" alt="Affinity Diagrams"/></figure>
  <div>
    <h3>Research Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Students generally feel safe when they see sanitization being done.</li>
      <li>Want information on hot zones, think it would be useful to know where people are contracting COVID on campus.</li>
      <li>Think that if bi-weekly testing was made mandatory it would more impactful.</li>
      <li>Concerned about people not taking COVID-19 seriously and unable to see where the virus has / could have been.</li>
      <li>Would like to see testing sites near / on campus and more campus buildings in the location density feature.</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Location density</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Peak time feature</li>
      <li>The max capacity value is alarming</li>
      <li>Accessibility for color blindness</li>
      <li>Unsure what has changed after the location density refreshes</li>
      <li>Way finding to the places shown in location density</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How could we address these concerns?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We wanted to design an interactive campus map including a real-time location density feature with all the buildings / common spaces on campus</li>
      <li>Wayfinding to campus buildings and essential resources (PPE, hand sanitizer, testing sites, etc.)</li>
      <li>Peak time feature showing when a particular space is busiest / most clustered</li>
      <li>Notification system for COVID-19 information such as the number of cases on campus</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Product description</h2>
    <p>The App Stay Safe UMIAMI will help UM students to find protection resources and testing locations on campus, avoid high risk areas on campus and update the population density of specific locations on campus in real time.
    <br>There is a map of the Coral Gable campus of the University of Miami in this App, and we will mark the locations of different buildings, PPE stations and hand sanitizer stations on the map. When students want to find a PPE station or a hand sanitizer station on campus, they can use our app to navigate them to the nearest station.
    <br>In some populated locations on campus such as libraries, restaurants, gyms, bookstores, etc., we will mark the density of people using colors and percentages next to the building on the map.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Concept map</h2>
    <p>I created a concept map to help me organize my findings about how to keep safe on campus.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/StaySafeUMiami/conceptmap.png" alt="Concept map" /></figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Features and functions</h2>
    <h3>Location Density</h3>
    <p>In some populated locations on campus such as libraries, restaurants, gyms, bookstores, etc., the app marks the density of people using colors and gives users suggestions next to the building on the map.
    <br>Users will see more information related to a location after they tap the icon near that location. For example, distance, location density and peak time, and the user can also see a “Make Appointment” button to make an appointment through the app.
    </p>
    <h3>PPE Station</h3>
    <p>Mark the stations; Navigation to a station; Shows available protective equipment;</p>
    <h3>Hand sanitizer stations</h3>
    <p>Mark the stations; Navigation to a station; Shows how much hand sanitizer left in a hand sanitizer station;</p>
    <h3>Restrooms</h3>
    <p>Mark the restrooms; Navigation to a restroom;</p>
    <h3>Testing stations</h3>
    <p>Mark the stations; Navigation to a station; Check the Peak time; Make an appointment at the selected testing station;</p>
    <h3>High-risk areas</h3>
    <p>Mark high-risk areas; Check confirmed cases in a selected high-risk area;</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Task Flow</h2>
    <p>After I finished researching, I started to work on the task flow, which was divided into 6 tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check location density in the Shall Student Center and make an appointment.</li>
      <li>Check available protective equipment in a PPE station and find a route to the selected PPE station.</li>
      <li>Check available Hand sanitizer in a Hand sanitizer station and find a route to the selected Hand sanitizer station.</li>
      <li>Find a restroom on campus and find a route to the selected restroom.</li>
      <li>Find High-risk areas on campus.</li>
      <li>Make an appointment for a coronavirus test on campus.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Site Map</h2>
    <p>After I finished task flow, I was ready to create a sitemap to visually present an overview of my interface design.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/StaySafeUMiami/sitemap.png" alt="Site Map" /></figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Design sketches</h2>
    <p>The sketch helped me reorganize my thoughts (how can I include all the functions?) and present the functions. This sketch is also an important reference for my wireframe design.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/StaySafeUMiami/sketch.png" alt="sketch" /></figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>According to the sketch, I created the first version of the wireframe design. I was trying to make the app simple and easy to use. I used Adobe XD to create the following pages.<br><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/c3530ffd-efa5-4943-ba30-5cdd72b588dd-9600/" class="link">View full wireframes</a></p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/StaySafeUMiami/Wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes" /></figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Annotated Wireframes</h2>
    <p>The pages below there are the annotated wireframes for the app design.<br><a href="Stay-Safe-UMiami/Annotated-Wireframes.pdf" class="link">View full annotated wireframes</a></p>
  </div>

  </figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>Since the app is made for Students at University of Miami, so I was trying to match the UMiami Color.<br>The icons were downloaded from iconfinder. The map was downloaded from miami.edu.</p>
  </div>
  <figure>

  </figure>
  <div>
    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>After all the research and wireframes, I finally created the prototype. The prototype is very similar to the wireframes.<br> Below are some of the pages of the final prototype.<br><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/47e47f24-6e4f-484f-a206-b3969d671522-12b7/" class="link">Link to final prototype</a></p>
