    <h2>I am a UX/UI Designer.</h2>
    <p>I am currently an interactive media graduate student from an intensive, two-year STEM-based graduate program from the University of Miami, School of Communications with a focus on UX Research and Interaction Design. Projected graduation date in May 2021.</p>
    <p>To me, a design is a discipline of rationality and sensibility. I tend to see the positive and valuable parts of everything to maintain my creative thinking and eliminate the complexity of my design problems.</p>
    <p>My interest in user experience design has helped developing my own design thinking. I tend to learn from every design and designers to gain the ability to transform work from concepts into reality. My sense of design has a high degree of enthusiasm, also through different levels of training, with the ability to apply computer programs and creative design concepts.
