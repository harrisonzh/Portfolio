    <h2>I am a UX Designer.</h2>
    <p>I recently completed an intensive, two-year STEM-based graduate program from the University of Miami, School of Communications earning a Master's degree in Interactive Media with a focus on UX Research and Interaction Design.<br>
    To me, a design is a discipline of rationality and sensibility. I tend to see the positive and valuable parts of everything to maintain my creative thinking and eliminate the complexity of my design problems.<br>
    My interest in digital art and design has helped developing my own design thinking. I tend to learn from every design and designers to gain the ability to transform work from concepts into reality. My sense of design has a high degree of enthusiasm, also through different levels of training, with the ability to apply computer programs and creative design concepts.
