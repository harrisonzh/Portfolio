    <h2>Product Description</h2>
    <p>Munch AI is an AI app that will identify what’s on the plate and calculate the percentage of the types of food group observed (protein, fat, carb...etc). It will then show how much of the daily nutrient requirement has been reached. After that, <strong>the app will give suggestions on what your next meal should be</strong> so you get all the nutrients you need in a day to sustain a healthy, nutritious diet.<br>
    We will focus on popular fast-food restaurants, including Shake Shack, McDonald's, Wendy’s, etc. Because that will help us to find clear nutrition information on their menu items.<br>
    The tools we used to design this AI application were Adobe illustrator and Miro for the mind map, concept map and personas, Adobe XD for prototyping and Xcode developer tool for testing and training the model for image recognition. Designed for a Design with AI class, Fall 2020.</p>

    <h2>Target User</h2>
    <p>The target user of this app will be for anyone who is looking to be healthy and want to learn more about their food choices and see if they have met the daily nutrient intake requirement.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
      <p>We did two competitor analysis to identify competitors, and understand their pros and cons.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/Competitor_analysis.webp" alt="Competitor analysis" /></figure>
    
  <div>    
  <h2>Concept Map</h2>
    <p>We first put together a mind map that helps us brainstorm and ideate. Then we used the mind map to create a concept map to help us identify and define the features and functions. The concept map is shown below, or use this <a href="MunchAI/MunchAI-concept-map.pdf" class="link">link</a> to visit the pdf file.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/Concept_map.webp" alt="Concept map" /></figure>

  <div>
    <h2>Features and Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify food by image recognition.</li>
      <li>Next meal suggestions.</li>
      <li>Show nutrient content of the food.</li>
      <li>Calculate daily nutrient requirement.</li>
      <li>Show how much of the daily nutrient requirement has been reached.</li>
      <li>Add a meal by user input.</li>
      <li>Set users' height and weight.</li>
      <li>View meal history.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    
  <div>    
  <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>From the list of features we sketched out the rough idea of how we want to have our app to look like. Next we created two personas to help us identify our target user group. Our target user group would be for people who want to eat healthy and keep track of their calories intake. They are interested in learning more about the nutrient content in the food they eat as well as getting next meal suggestions. The feature of providing next meal suggestion is an example of anticipatory design that improves the quality of decision making. It is a method of simplifying processes to the needs of users one step ahead of the user’s decision.</p>

  <div>
  <h2>Task Flow</h2>
    <p>We create a few task flows to identify key activities and interactions. Selected task flows are shown below.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/user_flow.webp" alt="Task Flow" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Site Map</h2>
    <p>After I finished task flows, I was ready to create a sitemap to define the information structure and what is presented in the MunchAI app. Site map is shown below.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/Sitemap.webp" alt="Site Map" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Design Sketches</h2>
    <p>Finally, we are ready to start our design, we started designing rough sketches of the app. After trying a lot of different sketches, these sketches help us to identify the interaction and app layouts for the prototype design. Selected final sketches are shown below.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/Sketch.webp" alt="sketch" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>According to the sketches, I created the first version of the wireframe design. I used Adobe XD to create the following pages. Selected wireframes are shown below, or use this <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/b5f7f6aa-e091-43e6-be2f-9ed99285cbc2-e0a4/" class="link">link</a> to view full wireframes.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Annotated Wireframes</h2>
    <p>In the pages below there are the selected annotated wireframe for MunchAI App design. Use this <a href="MunchAI/MunchAI-Annotated-Wireframes.pdf" class="link">link</a> to view full annotated wireframes.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>We wrote a usability test script and did four usability tests using our prototype. Below are the tasks on our usability test script.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check meal history.</li>
      <li>Find where you can set your height and weight</li>
      <li>Add a meal from shake shack.</li>
      <li>Use the flashlight to take the image</li>
      <li>Get next meal suggestion</li>
      <li>Take a picture of your meal.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After having our prototype tested our participants said that the prototype was simple to use. However there are areas where we can improve on the interaction of the app. Below there are the main feedbacks we got from the user testing.<br>Use this <a href="MunchAI/MunchAI-Feedbacks.pdf" class="link">link</a> to view all feedbacks.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/MunchAI-Feedback.webp" alt="Feedbacks" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>I use green as the main color of the MunchAI app to represent a healthy life style. I created this style guide and started the final prototype design according to this style guide.<br>The icons were downloaded from iconfinder.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/MunchAI/StyleGuide.webp" alt="Style Guide" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>After all the research and wireframes, I finally created the final prototype. Below are the selected pages of the final prototype and the video-Walkthrough of all the main functionality for MunchAI.<br>Use this <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/7983eec5-7f77-4094-8867-55738e127e93-2cd0/" class="link">link</a> to view the interactive final prototype.</p>
