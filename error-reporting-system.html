    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>Safety is the first priority in the workplace, and submit incident reports will help reduce incidents in the workplace and improve workplace safety. 
    <br>According to the research done by Dr.Millet. In the past, most incident reports were completed by using digital systems, and near miss reports were completed by using the printed form and verbal reports, and those report forms faced many problems, including:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>Type of data collected (mostly narrative)- Yields insufficient and inaccurate data;</li>
      <li>Too time consuming;</li>
      <li>Little opportunity to conduct quantitative analyses for quality improvement;</li>
      <li>Practical problems in printed form: forms not easily obtained and staff must be motivated to find one, fill it in, and then submit to the appropriate manager;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>MedicGuard is a webbased error reporting system for nursing home employees</strong>, the tools I used to design this system were Adobe illustrator and Miro for the mind map, concept map, sitemap, and task flow, Adobe XD for prototyping. Designed for a Human-Centered Design (HCD) class, Fall 2020.</p>

    <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
      <p>I did a secondary research to learn more about nursing department and how the system works, I focused on the flow questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is OSHA?</li>
      <li>What is incident?</li>
      <li>What is “near miss”?</li>
      <li>What is work-related injuries?</li>
      <li>Who can create a report?</li>
      <li>How to report an incident?</li>
      <li>Injury and Illness Recordkeeping Forms?</li>
      <li>What is the most common injuries types?</li>
      <li>What are the design precedents?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
    <p>MedicGuard is an error reporting system designed for the nursing home employees and administrators. The system has a dashboard page to show the recent activity in the workplace. Users are able to creating new reports, submitting reports, editing in progress reports, reviewing submitted reports, appending case documentations, populate OSHA/ Workers Comp forms on the system. The system will also determine a safety score of the work place according to the recent incidents and shows on the dashboard. MedicGuard error reporting system is also committed to reducing accidents through dashboard analysis.</p>

  <div>    
  <h2>Concept Map</h2>
    <p>I created a concept map to help me organize my thoughts about what do I want to inclued in MedicGuard Error Reporting System and how can I make this system easy to use? The concept map is shown below, or use this <a href="Error-Reporting-System/Conceptmap.pdf" class="link">link</a> to visit the pdf file.</p>

    <h2>Features and Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a new report</li>
      <li>Submitting a report</li>
      <li>Editing in progress report</li>
      <li>Reviewing a submitted report</li>
      <li>Appending a case documentation</li>

  <div>
  <h2>Task Flow</h2>
    <p>I create a few task flows to identify the key activities and interactions on MedicGuard Error Reporting System. Selected task flows are shown below, Use this <a href="Error-Reporting-System/TaskFlow.pdf" class="link">link</a> to view full task flows.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Site Map</h2>
    <p>After I finished task flows, I was ready to create a sitemap to visually present an overview of my interface design.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Design Sketches</h2>
    <p>The sketch helped me reorganize my thoughts (how can I include all the functions?) and present the functions. This sketch is also an important reference for my wireframe design. Selected final sketches are shown below, or use this <a href="Error-Reporting-System/Sketch.pdf" class="link">link</a> to view full sketches.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/ErrorReportingSystem/Sketches.webp" alt="sketch" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>According to the sketches, I created the first version of the wireframe design. I used Adobe XD to create the following pages. Selected wireframes are shown below, or use this <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ab85d489-8f1a-453f-8f21-14d992e576c8-fed6/" class="link">link</a> to view full wireframes.</p>

    <h2>Annotated Wireframes</h2>
    <p>In the pages below there are the selected annotated wireframes for the MedicGuard Error Reporting System design. Use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gpyE5fQdanN5LMcvrQJuMqNmMVaJ_tLrBO89kbeOJZ4/edit?usp=sharing" class="link">link</a> to view full annotated wireframes.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Style Guide</h2>
    <p>I use blue as the main color of the system, because blue makes people calm. Many reports require to submit on time. I hope users can be calm enough when using this system to avoid filling in wrong information. I created this style guide and started the final prototype design according to this style guide.<br>The icons were downloaded from iconfinder.</p>

    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>After all the research and wireframes, I finally created the prototype. Below there are the selected pages of the final prototype and the video-Walkthrough of all the main functionality for MedicGuard Error Reporting System.<br>Use this <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fa85a557-895f-4185-9ab2-dae934cc902f-afd6/" class="link">link</a> to view the interactive final prototype.</p>
