    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In order to display the landmark architectures in Miamiâ€™s historic district Coconut Grove, professor Kim Grinfeder led a team to collaborate with Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, University of Miami Library, and Lowe Art Museum to develop an APP which provide tourists and local residents with an interesting way to visit the famous historic district in downtown Miami: Coconut Grove.
    <br>Coconut Grove is a historic neighborhood with more than a century-old history. It is home to the most famous historical landmark in Miami: Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Plymouth Congregational Church, the hundred-year-old big banyan tree and the peacocks are everywhere in Coconut Grove. The City of Miami government is also located here.
    <br>Know Your Grove will take tourists to visit the famous buildings in the area by cycling or walking and provide tourists and local residents with an interesting way to visit, bringing a different cultural journey to our users.</p>
  </div>
    
    <div>
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>My role in the team is as a UX/UI designer. I conducted research on local residents, and used Adobe XD to complete the high-fidelity prototype design of the mobile app interface and the desktop version web interface. After the design is completed, I did a few user testing, and updated the prototype design based on user feedback. And then, I had a communication with the development team, solving the design problems encountered in the development process.</p>

    <h2>Product description</h2>
    <p>App Know Your Grove will help users find the locations of attractions in Coconut Grove and provide navigation based on the user's location.
    <br>There is a map of Coconut Grove in this app. We will mark different attractions on the map. When the user clicks on an attraction, a brief introduction about it will appear at the bottom of the screen. When the user arrives at the selected attraction, the user can scan the QR code to unlock it according to the prompt in the App, users can browse or listen to more information about the attraction and browse photos.
    <br>App Know Your Grove will also recommend nearby attractions based on the user's location, displaying unlocked attractions and the number of all attractions at the top. In addition to the map, there is also a list view of the attractions in the App, and users can use the list to select the attraction they are interested in or read attraction information.</p>
  </div>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Concept map</h2>
    <p>After completing the user research, I created a concept map. The concept map helps me understand how to achieve project goals by analyzing user needs and project goals, concept map are shown below, or use this <a href="Know-your-grove/KnowYourGroveConceptMap.pdf" class="link">link</a> to visit the pdf file.</p>

    <h2>Task flow</h2>
    <p>After completing the user research, I started to work on the task flow, which is divided into 4 tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Unlock a location.</li>
      <li>View unlocked locations.</li>
      <li>View remaining locations.</li>

  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/KnowYourGrove/KnowYourGroveTaskFlow.webp" alt="Task Flow" /></figure>
    
   <div>
    <h2>Site map</h2>
    <p>After I finished task flows, I was ready to create a sitemap to define the information structure and what is presented in the Know Your Grove app. Site map is shown below, or use this <a href="Know-your-grove/KnowYourGroveSiteMap.pdf" class="link">link</a> to visit the pdf file.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/KnowYourGrove/KnowYourGroveSiteMap.webp" alt="Site Map" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Sketch design</h2>
    <p>I started designing a sketch of the application on paper. Sketch design helps to clarify content relationships, potential interactions, and overall processes. I explored various ways to show how the content is displayed and structured.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/KnowYourGrove/Sketch.webp" alt="sketch" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>I created the first version of the wireframe design by using Adobe XD.</p>
  </div>
  <figure><img src="images/KnowYourGrove/Wireframes.webp" alt="Wireframes" /></figure>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Usability testing</h2>
    <p>I wrote a usability test script and performed 8 usability tests using the wireframe I designed. The following is the main content that I modified through user feedback:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Because most of the local residents are mid-aged and elderly, a help button has been added to the lower right corner of the application to quickly solve usage problems.</li>
      <li>Moved the bottom menu button to the top.</li>
      <li>Enlarged button size.</li>
      <li>Reduced the size of the number on the top and deleted the percentage diagram of the unlocked attractions.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <p>After all the research and wireframe design, I finally created the final prototype. The following are the selected pages of the final prototype design and a video made by Know Your Grove's creative director Kim Grinfeder to walkthrough of all the main functions of Know Your Grove.</p>
