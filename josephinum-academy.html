    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The audience for Josephinum Academy website is prospective families and prospective donors.</p>
      <h3>Prospective Family</h3>
      <p>The primary audience is prospective families in the Chicago area with kids in middle school. Priorities are to have their daughter attend a high school with great academics and activities while still being affordable. They want to prepare their daughter for college. This can be an exciting time for prospective families but also a bit overwhelming. They are often looking for specific things for their daughter to participate in (i.e. debate club, basketball, swimming).</p>
      
      <h3>Prospective Donors</h3>
      <p>Prospective donors are Chicago-based private donors, corporate and mission-aligned nonprofits. The donors have a connection to Catholic education, girls' education/empowerment, improved educational opportunities for inner city/low-income families, Latina community support, African American community support, and IB education. They are looking to further their contribution in these areas by donating to Josephinum. The donor needs to know why they should donate, what the donation goes towards, the values and mission of the school, verification that the school received the donation, and what specific project their money is going towards. </p>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>We made plans on Trello to start our project. Each task is assigned to a team member, with a detailed introduction and a deadline. The number behind the task represent the level of importance of this task. We will move the task to the “Done” section when the task is completed.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>Collectively we interviewed 4 parents of Josephinum students to learn more about the process of finding a high school in the Chicago area. Through these in-depth interviews, we were able to understand the needs and goals of one of the main users of the Josephinum Website.
    <br>Research questions and findings are shown below.<br>Use this <a href="JosephinumAcademyoftheSacredHeart/Josephinum-Academy-of-the-Sacred-Heart-Research.pdf" class="link">link</a> to view the pdf file.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Site existing problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Search Bar is in the bottom of the page, hard to find.</li>
      <li>Hard to find "contact us".</li>
      <li>Try to type "letter" in credit card number, did not show me anything until I submit.</li>
      <li>Images on each page busy and distracting.</li>
      <li>Overlay logo only for home page, not for each page.</li>
      <li>Donate page long and boring, could be condensed.</li>
      <li>Too many long videos.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>To begin our competitive analysis, we researched four high schools in the Chicago area to find websites that would be reasonable to compare to Josephinum. After reviewing the four websites, we created a structured list of questions to find how those websites perform as a high school website. We considered calls to action, photography, donation pages, mobile optimization and how the school conveys their brand. After we conducted the competitive analyses, we have come to the conclusion that the competitors have a few advancements in their websites that we agree would be a good idea to emulate when redesigning the Josephinum website.

  <div>
    <h2>Features and Functions</h2>
    <p>The application and shadowing/visiting scenario will be essential to the experience because of the client’s goal. The home page will also need to show why josephinum is so special and a brief info section about them. This info section will include key facts, statistics, and values that represent the quality of the school but will find a balance between necessary knowledge and more detailed descriptions. From the home page will be direct links to apply and donate, as these are the desired destinations for our core audiences. Users should be able to easily navigate to the application page and/or donation page, and quickly and effortlessly complete each process respectively. The user will complete a form (that should be intuitive and easily understood) for both the application page and donation page. After submitting the form, a confirmation page will appear to indicate the completion of the process.</p>
  </div>
    
  <div>
    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>We made two personas based on the two types of customers we have, the prospective family and a donor after our interviews. We do our best to make them more like a real person and think about their needs and goals when we doing design works.</p>

    <h2>Story Boards</h2>
    <p>We made a story board based on the persona Jo’s family, they are trying to enroll Jane(the kid) to a school that will prepare her for the collage.</p>

    <h2>Open Card Sort</h2>
    <p>Our team conducted an open card sort study using OptimalSort. We gave participants the task of organizing 37 “cards” each containing a title from the current Josephinum website navigation into category names that made sense.  The final study included responses from 41 participants, 16 of them being parents. The purpose of this test was to evaluate how users group the content of the Josephinum website and in what categories.</p>

    <h2>Test, Iterate, Repeat</h2>
    <p>We use the first set of the wireframe to collect usability test data. We continue to revise the wireframe design based on the usability test data. <br>We have 8 interviewees accpeted to be interviewed.
